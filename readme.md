# 100 Days of Code

### 100 Days of Code challenges developers (irrespective of their expertise) specifically to maintain a consistent habit to code for a certain period of time. Due the lack of consistency in coding, I have decided to take up this challange and be a better developer.

### In order to follow this challenge, there are certian set of rules that i'll be following:
- Daily Commit on GitHub
- Updating this repo with daily learnings
- If missed one day, don't miss the second
- Weekly LinkedIn/X post about learnings/progress
### There's a certain misconception about this challege that: just commiting for streaks or github contribution graph will change nothing. But I consider this as a challenge to be consistent and discplined each day.

### About me: I am an aspiring Software Engineer and Web3 Developer. I like to make impactful projects, contribute in open source and learn along the way. I am currently learning full stack and solana developemnt, DevOps and AIML.


	Starting the Challenge form 8th March, 2025 to 15th June, 2025
